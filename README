Easily create a .env file inside the main folder of your Django project from the paramaters set using decouple in settings.py.

You can either put this script in the parent folder of your Django project or indicate the path to it when running the script.

Generate a .env file with 'test' values as default or enter manually the values you need for each decouple key.
